Introduction
The goal of this project is to build a classification model that can predict labels for text data. The dataset used is likely a collection of comments or reviews, and the task involves sentiment classification or similar binary/multi-class text classification.

Features
This notebook covers the following key features:

Data Loading: Reading text data from CSV files.
Preprocessing: Cleaning and vectorizing text using TF-IDF.
Modeling: Using several machine learning models:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
Gradient Boosting Classifier
XGBoost Classifier
Hyperparameter Tuning: Using GridSearchCV to optimize models.
Evaluation: Evaluating models using accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
Visualization: Plotting precision-recall curves and confusion matrices.
Requirements
The notebook requires the following libraries:

pandas
numpy
re
seaborn
matplotlib
scikit-learn
xgboost
tabulate
You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn xgboost tabulate
Usage
Clone the Repository:


bash
jupyter notebook Assignment.ipynb
Run the Notebook: Execute the cells in sequence to perform the full analysis.

Methodology
1. Data Understanding
Loading the dataset using pandas.
Initial data exploration and cleaning.
2. Preprocessing
Text preprocessing steps like removing special characters using regular expressions.
Feature extraction using TF-IDF Vectorization.
Encoding categorical labels if necessary using LabelEncoder.
3. Model Training
Training multiple classifiers:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
XGBoost
Performing train-test split using train_test_split.
4. Hyperparameter Tuning
Using GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for each model.
5. Model Evaluation
Evaluating models using:
Accuracy Score
F1 Score
Precision-Recall Curve
Confusion Matrix
Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy: Measures the proportion of correct predictions.
F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, useful for imbalanced datasets.
Confusion Matrix: Visualizes the performance of a classification algorithm.
Precision-Recall Curve: Plots precision against recall to understand the trade-offs.
Results
The notebook includes visualizations and detailed reports for each model, helping identify the best-performing classifier based on the evaluation metrics.
